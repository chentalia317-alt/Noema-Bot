2025-10-28 Progress Log
Today's Focus: Worked mainly on debugging the analysis flow 
- Integrated full report + dashboard generation (noema-report.qd, dashboard.qd).
- Fixed missing .qd path in GitHub Actions (./reports/...).
- Added dashboard HTML card layout, but Quarkdown rendered it as plain text → needs .allowhtml {true}.
- Later runs failed at Resolve FILE due to debug output polluting $GITHUB_OUTPUT (multi-line text interpreted as commands).
- Root cause: unsafe string expansion in workflow; not Python logic.
Next steps:
1. Clean and stabilize workflow:
Replace Resolve FILE and Read summary with safe output versions.
Re-run /analyze to confirm pipeline stability.
2. Fix dashboard rendering:
Add .allowhtml {true} correctly at top of dashboard.qd.
Verify Quarkdown compiles cards properly.
3. Finalize the report → ensure both /index.html (dashboard) and /report.html display cleanly.
