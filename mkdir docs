2025-10-28 Progress Log
Today's Focus: Worked mainly on debugging the analysis flow 
Tried to make the bot handle multiple data tables at once, but the thumbnails didn’t render yet.  
Planning to add automatic column detection for each table to generate plots dynamically.  
Also noticed Quarkdown still outputs everything under “Untitled-Quarkdown-Document,” which makes the path messy.  
Might fix it later by adding a title argument or manually renaming the output folder.

Next steps:
- Get multi-table thumbnails to render properly  
- Test the column detection logic  
- Clean up the HTML output path
