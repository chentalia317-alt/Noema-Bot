# Noema-BotüòÑ

> *Merging analysis, automation, and aesthetics in open science.*

Noema-Bot, created by [@TaliaChen](https://github.com/chentalia317-alt), is a modular research assistant that **analyzes data, generates dynamic reports, and transforms scientific results into simple, reproducible web pages**.
It integrates lightweight Python analysis pipelines with **Quarkdown-based HTML rendering**, creating an end-to-end framework for transparent, automated scientific reporting.

## Overview

Modern research often faces two common challenges:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Repetitive analysis workflows**: running the same data cleaning, visualization, and reporting steps for every new dataset.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Inconsistent formatting and documentation**: results are stored in different styles and formats, making reproducibility difficult.  

HOWEVER! **Noema-Bot** is designed to address those problems.  
It acts as a lightweight automation layer that connects **data ‚Üí analysis ‚Üí visualization ‚Üí publication**, all within a single reproducible environment.  

Instead of being just another script runner, **Noema-Bot** functions as a *mini framework for open, aesthetic, and transparent research* , helping users transform raw data into structured, publication-ready web reports with minimal effort.


## Aims to

**Students and early-career researchers**  
- who want to build reproducible workflows, analyze experimental data, and generate professional-looking reports ‚Äî all through clear, readable Python scripts.

**Educators and mentors**  
- looking for a simple, open-source example to teach data analysis, visualization, or automation principles.

**Independent developers and open-science contributors**  
- who want a modular base to extend their own pipelines or integrate automated reports directly with GitHub Actions.

**Anyone exploring the intersection of science, design, and automation**  
- who values clarity, aesthetics, and transparency in how knowledge is produced and shared.

## Features

- **Automatic data analysis** via Python scripts  
  ‚Üí Supports `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.json`, and experimental data formats  
- **Customizable Quarkdown rendering**  
  ‚Üí Converts analytical outputs into interactive HTML reports  
- **GitHub Actions integration**  
  ‚Üí Trigger analyses automatically using `/analyze` commands or manual dispatch  
- **Modular structure**  
  ‚Üí Easily extendable for new datasets or analysis types  
- **Beautiful report templates**  
  ‚Üí Scientific yet minimal design for public sharing or presentation

## Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Run locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chentalia317-alt<your-username>/Noema-Bot.git
cd Noema-Bot
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/analyze.py
```


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run via GitHub Actions
Comment in an Issue:
**/analyze** + files name (example: /analyze file=panda.csv) or manually trigger the workflow from the Actions tab.
<br>
Your analysis results and report will be automatically uploaded to the repository.

### üß© *Note:* The current version of **Noema-Bot** only supports **histogram visualization**.  
However, the analysis pipeline is designed to be **modular and extensible**, allowing future integration of more advanced visualization methods (e.g., boxplots, density curves, and correlation heatmaps).  
This structure makes it easy to expand Noema-Bot as a general-purpose scientific analysis assistant over time.
