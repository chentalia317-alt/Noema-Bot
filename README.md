# Noema-BotüòÑ

> *Merging analysis, automation, and aesthetics in open science.*

Noema-Bot, created by [@TaliaChen](https://github.com/chentalia317-alt), is a modular research assistant that **analyzes data, generates dynamic reports, and transforms scientific results into simple, reproducible web pages**.
It integrates lightweight Python analysis pipelines with **Quarkdown-based HTML rendering**, creating an end-to-end framework for transparent, automated scientific reporting.

## Overview

Modern research often struggles with repetitive data processing and inconsistent report formatting.  
**Noema-Bot** aims to bridge that gap by automating the workflow from raw data ‚Üí analysis ‚Üí visualization ‚Üí publication-ready report.

It‚Äôs designed for:
- Students or researchers who need **fast, reproducible data analysis**
- Developers building **automated pipelines for open science**
- Anyone who values **clarity, structure, and aesthetic presentation** in their research outputs

## Features

- **Automatic data analysis** via Python scripts  
  ‚Üí Supports `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.json`, and experimental data formats  
- **Customizable Quarkdown rendering**  
  ‚Üí Converts analytical outputs into interactive HTML reports  
- **GitHub Actions integration**  
  ‚Üí Trigger analyses automatically using `/analyze` commands or manual dispatch  
- **Modular structure**  
  ‚Üí Easily extendable for new datasets or analysis types  
- **Beautiful report templates**  
  ‚Üí Scientific yet minimal design for public sharing or presentation

## Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Run locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chentalia317-alt<your-username>/Noema-Bot.git
cd Noema-Bot
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/analyze.py
```


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run via GitHub Actions
Comment in an Issue:
**/analyze** + files name (example: /analyze file=panda.csv) or manually trigger the workflow from the Actions tab.
<br>
Your analysis results and report will be automatically uploaded to the repository.

### üß© *Note:* The current version of **Noema-Bot** only supports **histogram visualization**.  
However, the analysis pipeline is designed to be **modular and extensible**, allowing future integration of more advanced visualization methods (e.g., boxplots, density curves, and correlation heatmaps).  
This structure makes it easy to expand Noema-Bot as a general-purpose scientific analysis assistant over time.
