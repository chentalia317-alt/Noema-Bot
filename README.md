# Noema-BotüòÑ(1.0 version-October 2025)

> *Merging analysis, automation, and aesthetics in open science.*

Noema-Bot, created by [@TaliaChen](https://github.com/chentalia317-alt), is a modular research assistant that **analyzes data, generates dynamic reports, and transforms scientific results into simple, reproducible web pages**.
It integrates lightweight Python analysis pipelines with **Quarkdown-based HTML rendering**, creating an end-to-end framework for transparent, automated scientific reporting.

## Overview

Modern research often faces two common challenges:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Repetitive analysis workflows**: running the same data cleaning, visualization, and reporting steps for every new dataset.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Inconsistent formatting and documentation**: results are stored in different styles and formats, making reproducibility difficult.  

HOWEVER! **Noema-Bot** is designed to address those problems.  
It acts as a lightweight automation layer that connects **data ‚Üí analysis ‚Üí visualization ‚Üí publication**, all within a single reproducible environment.  

Instead of being just another script runner, **Noema-Bot** functions as a *mini framework for open, aesthetic, and transparent research* , helping users transform raw data into structured, publication-ready web reports with minimal effort.


## Aims to

**Noema-Bot** is built to make automated, reproducible reporting accessible across different levels of research and development.

---

### Students and early-career researchers
- who want to structure their data workflows, analyze experimental results, and generate clean, professional reports ‚Äî all through readable Python code.  

### Educators and mentors
- who need a simple, open-source teaching example to demonstrate reproducible analysis, visualization, or automation principles in class.  

### Citizen scientists and independent learners
- who conduct small-scale studies or personal experiments and want to share findings transparently using open tools.  

### Developers and data enthusiasts
- who are exploring how to integrate Python analysis scripts with GitHub Actions or automate analytical pipelines in public repositories.  

### Open-science and reproducibility advocates
- who value transparent, version-controlled research workflows and want a lightweight tool to support FAIR data practices.  

### Interdisciplinary creators
- combining design, storytelling, and science, seeking an aesthetic yet rigorous way to present research or data-driven projects.

  ‚Üí Supports `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.json`, and experimental data formats  
- **Customizable Quarkdown rendering**  
  ‚Üí Converts analytical outputs into interactive HTML reports  
- **GitHub Actions integration**  
  ‚Üí Trigger analyses automatically using `/analyze` commands or manual dispatch  
- **Modular structure**  
  ‚Üí Easily extendable for new datasets or analysis types  
- **Beautiful report templates**  
  ‚Üí Scientific yet minimal design for public sharing or presentation

## Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Run locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chentalia317-alt<your-username>/Noema-Bot.git
cd Noema-Bot
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/analyze.py
```


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run via GitHub Actions
Comment in an Issue:
**/analyze** + files name (example: /analyze file=panda.csv) or manually trigger the workflow from the Actions tab.
<br>
Your analysis results and report will be automatically uploaded to the repository.

---

### üß© *Note:* The current version of **Noema-Bot** only supports **histogram visualization**.  
However, the analysis pipeline is designed to be **modular and extensible**, allowing future integration of more advanced visualization methods (e.g., boxplots, density curves, and correlation heatmaps).  
This structure makes it easy to expand Noema-Bot as a general-purpose scientific analysis assistant over time.

---
## Future Plans (WIP)

The current version of **Noema-Bot** focuses on basic visualization (only histogram) and automated report generation.  
In upcoming updates, the project aims to expand its analytical and rendering capabilities to include:

- **Advanced visualizations** ‚Äî integration of boxplots, density plots, correlation heatmaps, and time-series analysis...  
- **Modular analytics** ‚Äî support for plug-in modules that allow users to add their own data-processing scripts.  
- **Enhanced Quarkdown templates** ‚Äî improved report aesthetics, multi-section layouts, and interactive charts.  
- **Cross-dataset automation** ‚Äî enabling batch analysis for multiple files or longitudinal datasets.  
- **Web publishing** ‚Äî direct rendering of Quarkdown reports to GitHub Pages or other static-site platforms.  

The long-term goal is to turn **Noema-Bot** into a flexible, open-source and effective assistant for transparent and aesthetic scientific reportingü§©.
