# Noema-Bot

> *Merging analysis, automation, and aesthetics in open science.*

Noema-Bot, created by [@TaliaChen](https://github.com/chentalia317-alt), is a modular research assistant that **analyzes data, generates dynamic reports, and transforms scientific results into elegant, reproducible web pages**.
It integrates lightweight Python analysis pipelines with **Quarkdown-based HTML rendering**, creating an end-to-end framework for transparent, automated scientific reporting.

## Overview

Modern research often struggles with repetitive data processing and inconsistent report formatting.  
**Noema-Bot** aims to bridge that gap by automating the workflow from raw data → analysis → visualization → publication-ready report.

It’s designed for:
- Students or researchers who need **fast, reproducible data analysis**
- Developers building **automated pipelines for open science**
- Anyone who values **clarity, structure, and aesthetic presentation** in their research outputs

## Features

- **Automatic data analysis** via Python scripts  
  → Supports `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.json`, and experimental data formats  
- **Customizable Quarkdown rendering**  
  → Converts analytical outputs into interactive HTML reports  
- **GitHub Actions integration**  
  → Trigger analyses automatically using `/analyze` commands or manual dispatch  
- **Modular structure**  
  → Easily extendable for new datasets or analysis types  
- **Beautiful report templates**  
  → Scientific yet minimal design for public sharing or presentation
